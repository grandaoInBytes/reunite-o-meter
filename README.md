## ðŸš€ How to Customize

Personalizing this page is easy. Follow these steps:

### 1\. Set Your Dates

  * In `script.js`, change `reunionDate` to your event's end date and `startDate` to its start date.
    ```javascript
    // Set your target and start dates
    const reunionDate = new Date('July 31, 2025 16:00:00').getTime();
    const startDate = new Date('May 13, 2025 16:00:00').getTime();
    ```

### 2\. Change the Images

1.  Add your own photos to the `images/` folder.
2.  In `script.js`, update the `backgroundImages` array with your new file paths.
    ```javascript
    const backgroundImages = [
        'images/my-photo1.jpg',
        'images/my-photo2.png',
        // ... add all your image paths here
    ];
    ```

### 3\. Edit the Text

  * Change the main title directly in `index.html`.
    ```html
    <h1>ðŸ’˜ Vacanza in Italia ðŸ’˜</h1>
    ```

### 4\. (Optional) Tweak the Colors

  * All colors are defined as variables in `style.css` under the `:root` section for easy editing.
    ```css
    :root {
      --primary-color: #9370DB; /* MediumPurple */
      /* ... change any color you want here ... */
    }
    ```
